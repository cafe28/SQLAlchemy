My climate_starter file is an analysis of weather data from Hawaii, specifically precipitation and temperature measurements. The main objective of this code is to perform an exploratory analysis of weather data from Hawaii, specifically focusing on precipitation and temperature measurements.

The code follows a structured approach to achieve this objective:
1- Data Exploration and Preparation: The code starts by connecting to the SQLite database containing the weather data. It reflects the database tables into SQLAlchemy ORM classes, which allows for easier interaction with the data.

2- Precipitation Analysis: The code identifies the most recent date in the data set. It then calculates the date one year prior to the most recent date.  A query is executed to retrieve the precipitation data for the last 12 months, starting from the most recent date. The precipitation data is then analyzed and visualized using Pandas and Matplotlib.
The summary statistics for the precipitation data are also calculated.

3- Station Analysis: The code determines the total number of stations in the dataset. It then identifies the most active stations, i.e., the stations with the most rows of data. For the most active station, the code calculates the lowest, highest, and average temperature. The results are stored in a new DataFrame.

4- Temperature Histogram: The code retrieves the temperature observation data for the last 12 months for the most active station. A histogram is then plotted to visualize the distribution of temperatures.
